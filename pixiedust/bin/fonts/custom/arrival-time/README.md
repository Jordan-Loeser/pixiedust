## Arrival Time

Arrival Time is a `.bdf`` font that replicates the font used on MTA Arrival Time signs.

<!-- TODO: insert image of arrival time sign -->

Referencing found and taken images, the font was replicated in `BitFontMaker2`, exported as a `.ttf`, and converted into a `.bdf` using [FontForge](https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-fonts-for-pyportal-circuitpython-display/overview).
