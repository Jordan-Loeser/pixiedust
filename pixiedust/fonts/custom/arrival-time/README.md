![Picture of an MTA arrival time sign at 77th street](https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/riders_alliance_countdownclocksreport1220162270520018jpg)

Arrival Time is a font provided in `.bdf` and `.ttf` formats that replicates the font used on MTA Arrival Time signs.

<!-- TODO: insert image of arrival time sign -->

Referencing found and taken images, the font was designed by hand in `BitFontMaker2`, exported as a `.ttf`, and converted into a `.bdf` using [FontForge](https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-fonts-for-pyportal-circuitpython-display/overview).
