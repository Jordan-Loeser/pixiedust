# Widgets

The [Widget](../classes/Widget.ts) class represents a basic graphical element on an HTML canvas, providing a foundation for more specialized widgets. It includes properties for the x and y coordinates for positioning. The class takes a CanvasRenderingContext2D as a parameter, which allows the widget to draw directly on the Applet's canvas.

Users can customize the position of the widget by passing WidgetOptions during instantiation, specifying x and y values. This class is designed to be extended for creating various graphical components within a canvas environment.
